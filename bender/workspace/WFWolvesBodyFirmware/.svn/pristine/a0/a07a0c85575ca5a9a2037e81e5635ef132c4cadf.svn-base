-- For compiling you need arm-elf-gcc with support for arm7tdmi. Look for the
GNUARM toolchain at <http://www.gnuarm.com>. This supports Linux, Mac OS and
Windows via Cygwin.

-- For uploading the firmware via USB cable you will need to install the SAM-BA
uploader. Linux users can download one such uploader from the following link:
<ftp://ftp.linux4sam.org/devel/tools/sam-ba_cdc_2.7.linux_01.zip>
Mac users can use this one:
<http://ghostwood.org/software/macSamba.html>
Windows users can use the official tool provided by ATMEL in their website.

-- For uploading the firmware via JTAG you need a JTAG programmer cable or
adapter. You can use OpenOCD: <http://www.yagarto.de/>



  COMPILING

If you already have everything in place just type make. This will compile and
link the firmware and generate a file named main.bin which should be uploaded
to the robot controller.
